              <h2>Anushka Mathur</h2>
              <p class="title">President,Founding Member</p>
              <p> Anushka is a 21 year old self-loving human who embraces life with all her emotions. A determined feminist in both ideology, and personality, she is opinionated, vocal, unapologetic and an advocate we really require. A firm believer in the polity of the personal, she calls out people as much as she loves them. Her childhood dream, which is more like an obsession, is to fly to and settle in one of the Scandinavian counties and ‘explore the world’. You cannot change her mind! An adoptive extrovert, she is a hard-working student, and is trying to be an equally brilliant activist. Apart from all this heavily loaded blast, she is a pathetic believer of the fact that she will look better in pencil heels even if they cut break through her ankles.  Another heads up her homies give for her is that she ain't getting grossed out by nobody!</p>

              <h2>Adarsh Meher</h2>
              <p class="title">Vice president,Founding Member</p>
              <p> Karen Walrond once said, "Be loud about the things that are important to you." What makes Adarsh weird is he could sleep literally anywhere and go to restaurants, movies and trips alone. He could be terrifyingly comfortable with his own company. He could talk for hours about food and books. He loves solitude and strangers. Yet, something is always missing in his life. 

                At no point of life did he know that he would choose law one day. But it has given him a better perspective, and a hope to stand up and do something about all the atrocities.
                There are so many things wrong in this world, and there are only so many you can do something about.

        <h2>Tanmay Mathur</h2>
        <p class="title">Secretary,Founding Member</p>
        <p> Tanmay is a 20 year old coffee addict with an inquisitive mind and an unerring knowledge about 90% of the world's population (or as is commonly known, gossip) and is always on the lookout for more. He is also a Pandora of information so one might not want to engage in any kind of debates with him, especially political ones. To say the least, Tanmay is funny, charming and fiercely loyal to those close to him, but you just need to make him like you first. He has wildly imaginative (and just plain weird) solutions for every problem that has ever existed which is just to say he is very creative. But mostly he won't put his brain to use because he's more lazy than the rest of the world's population combined. In conclusion, Tanmay is a vibrant and passionate soul with fixed ideals, and rather cynical thoughts which if you pause and think about, are nearly always right.</p>

        <h2>Anushka Pandey</h2>
        <p class="title">Social Media Coordinator,founding Member</p>
        <p> Anushka is a solitude seeker, you will always find her perplexed around people. Partly because she can't stand the rampant homophobia, sexism and racism and the other times because she has learnt to find solace in her own company. 
          Her coping mechanism to deal with existential crisis is to gobble up food or constantly ask for decent biryani suggestions or fangirl over Shashi Tharoor, Manto and Tagore.
          Besides being a food connoisseur, Anushka is an ardent feminist. She's seen womxn around her struggle, her inability  to help them has bothered her. But now with devouring feminist literature as much as she can, she realises the fight isn't against the society but oneself - unlearning even the smallest thing that the society has entrenched in our minds.

        <h2>Rashi Jeph</h2>
        <p class="title">Podcast Coordinator,Founding Member</p>
        <p> Rashi is an 18-year-old, typical girl next door with a brilliant mind and geeky habits. She is a passionate student of law yet her standard response to most of the questions is “idk” or a shoulder shrug or, worse, both. She is a dedicated, hard-working individual who does anything but study, and manages to outrank all her batch-mates by traumatizing them with her lame jokes. Despite her dorkiness, Rashi can be a really fun person to hang out with if you just give her an ice-cream and pledge to protect her from dogs. To sum up, she is a beautiful person with a beautiful heart determined to challenge the patriarchal notions and gender roles that, to her dismay, even the most educated ones do not realize the perils of.</p>

          <p class="title">Compaign Coordinator,Founding Member</p>
          <p> The moment you will set your eyes upon Amrita, you'll know that Phoebe Buffay is her spirit animal. She has a laugh that can make heads turn. She would speak up where most would not even dare to stand. She is that friend who would even die for you, and sometimes, perhaps kill. She may be crumbling inside but she will give you company for brunch so you are not alone. She may share her ice-cream with you but you will have to fight with her for the last bite of the cone.
            But what stands out about her is she stands up for what she believes in. She does not endure, she does not tolerate. She will kick someone on the face if he or she is asking for it. She has learnt it over time, that remaining silent doesn't help.

His love for the animals as well as for nature, which he captures in his beautiful photographs is astonishing.
